Because the player now knows where they are,\na circle of grass around them becomes transparent for 1/4 - 1/3 of a second.\nAlso when they move, the grass becomes slightly transparent. The transparency level goes down\n(or the opaqueness goes up) the farther away the rodent-like creature is.\n\nWhen they move they also rustle the grass that they touch, and maybe sometimes they eat grass\n\nThey will often wait until the player is deep in the grass to make their move:\n\nBefore starting to dart around, they will sometimes (30% of the time) make a\nrodent-like battlecry before starting to attack.\n\nFor the attack phase, they dash toward you, and also will fake you out by dashing away or to the side.\n\nIf they get near you, they wind up and then bite you\n\nIf they're REAL smart, maybe they can team up and try to surround you",

If you run, you either have to guess \nby the grass that it rustles or just run out of the grass to lure it out and then kill it\n\nbecause it only makes the attack call and makes the grass transparent ONCE\n\n-- time only slows down if it is able to do something very cinematic with the grass, wind, maybe\nrain and rind sounds that also slow down. Maybe light clouds sometimes.\nMaybe spiders only come in the dark, rainy tall-grass type areas",
